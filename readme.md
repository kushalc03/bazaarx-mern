# BazaarX

Growing up in the immigrant community of south Fremont, California in the Bay Area, in the absence of authentic food and snacks at restaurants, many families and stay-at-home parents would run entire businesses cooking traditional food from their homes, connecting with customers over WhatsApp / WeChat. This food would often be feeding hundreds of people at family get-togethers. Similarly, many stay-at-home mothers would make small snacks and run businesses out of their homes, selling macaroons, samosas, or sweets for people to pick up. I wanted to streamline the process of buying and selling food using BazaarX, where customers can find all the households in their area selling authentic food and where sellers can expand their customer base to people not as familiar with their food!
